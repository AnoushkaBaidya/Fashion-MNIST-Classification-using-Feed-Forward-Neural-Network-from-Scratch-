# Classification of Fashion Items using a Multi-Layer Neural Network from Scratch

Trained a multi-layer neural network to classify images of fashion items from the Fashion MNIST dataset. 
The cross-entropy cost function was used for training, with stochastic gradient descent.

This provides a comprehensive analysis of building a neural network from scratch for the classification of fashion items.

Hyperparameter tuning on the validation set is conducted to optimize the network's performance. 
 
Hyperparameters List for Tuning:
1. Number of hidden layers
2. Number of units in each hidden layer
3. Learning Rate
4. Minibatch Size
5. Number of Epochs
6. L2 regularization strength

## Test Accuracy and Loss
